Gesture-Based Calculator ðŸ§®âœ‹
Category: Computer Vision
Technologies: MediaPipe, Python, OpenCV, CVZone

A real-time hand gesture recognition system that transforms finger movements into interactive calculator inputs. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”by simply using their hands.

ðŸ“¸ Using a webcam, the calculator tracks the index finger and thumb proximity to detect button presses. The interface appears on-screen and responds to gestures without the need for physical contactâ€”enabling a fun, contactless, and intuitive way to compute.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Real-time finger tracking with MediaPipe

Gesture-based button selection using CVZone

On-screen calculator interface rendered with OpenCV

Seamless and interactive user experience with live webcam feed
